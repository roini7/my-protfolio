Built a TCP-based K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier in C++, integrating real-time data categorization with a scalable server-client architecture.

**Highlights:**

- **Dynamic Learning:** Uses a linear regression model for training and classifying new data.
- **Scalable Design:** Multi-threaded server handles multiple clients and large file transfers efficiently.
- **Command Pattern:** Modular implementation separates execution from user interaction.
